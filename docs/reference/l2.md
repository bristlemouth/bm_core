# L2

Within the Bristlemouth stack,
the L2 layer is responsible for monitoring how the upper layers of the IP stack interact with the 10BASE-T1L ethernet driver.
The code itself interacts and follows the below diagram:

## Responsibilities

The L2 layer is the glue between the network layer of the IP stack and the network device (AKA the 10BASE-T1L ethernet driver).
It controls the flow of data to and from each of those layers.
The following is an in-depth explanation of how each of its responsibilities work:

- Receive Events
  - The network device will receive a packet and pass the raw data to `bm_l2_rx`
  - Then creates a new buffer through the IP stack abstraction and copies the raw data from the packet to this buffer,
  - Following,
  it then queues up this data to be handled in the `bm_l2_thread`
  - During handling,
  if the packet is a multicast packet (a packet that is sent to a group of interested receivers),
  it is transmitted down the wire to other nodes
  - The packet is then submitted to the upper layers of the IP stack with `bm_l2_submit`,
  so that it may processed
- Transmit Events
  - Transmission messages are sent through the IP stack from upper layers,
  and are then fed through `bm_l2_link_output`
  - `bm_l2_link_output` then preps the message,
  utilizing the `bm_l2_prep` function,
  and sends it to a queue which is handled in the `bm_l2_thread`
  - When processed,
  the message is then sent to the network device to be transmitted on the line
- Link Up/Down Events
  - During initialization,
  a callback is passed into the network device as a trait in order to handle when the link to a port has been dropped or opened
  - When a link is brought up or down,
  an event is queued up to be handled in the `bm_l2_thread`,
  which has the port associated with the event and whether or not the link is up or down
  - When handled,
  a variable is set to report to outside modules whether or not the port is up or down (utilizing `bm_l2_get_port_state`),
  and a callback is invoked to report to other concerned parties about the state of the port
